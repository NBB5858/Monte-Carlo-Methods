# MC and MCMC Refresher

[__In Progress__] This repository contains my solutions to selected exercises
from the book _Monte Carlo theory, methods, and examples. (see [here for an online version](https://artowen.su.domains/mc/)).
The goal of this work was to serve as a refresher to Monte Carlo methods, which I did 
some work with in graduate school.
